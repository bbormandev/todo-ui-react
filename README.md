## React Todo App

This is a demo project that creates a Todo app using Vite + React + TypeScript. It is bootstrapped from the `react-ts` Vite template to get up and running quickly. It also uses Tailwind CSS with ShadCN UI to quickly iterate on design and implementation of components.

### Getting Started

Requires Node version 19+.

Within the project directory run:

`npm run init`
`npm run dev`

This will start up the Vite local server, most commonly at `http://localhost:5173/`.
